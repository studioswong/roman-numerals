Simple React app for conversion of Roman Numerals to Integers.

The app also includes some preliminary snapshot test setup with Enzyme and Jest. Please note that the test setup does not support import of svg files, hence the test for the main App.js file would fail.

To start the app, run npm start.
To start the tests, run npm test.
